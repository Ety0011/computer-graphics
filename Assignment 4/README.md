# Assignment 4: Advanced ray-tracing

**Authors**: Etienne Orio, Leonardo Asaro

## Solved Exercises

This submission includes solutions to the following exercises:

- **Exercise 1**: Shadows.
- **Exercise 2**: Reflection.
- **Bonus Exercise 3**: Refraction.

## Encountered Problems

It wasnt explained how to calculate shadows with refractive objects so we made up a solution for it.

We werent able to figure out how to complete exercise 4. In particular we implemented it but then we didnt manage to get the blue sphere to be reflective.
