# Bonus assignment: Spatial Data Structures

**Authors**: Etienne Orio, Leonardo Asaro

## Version A: Performance with and without bounding box optimization

Runs were performed with an image 320 x 240 while shadows were still not implemented.

- **Without bounding box optimization**:  
  - Render Time: 212.082 seconds  
  - Frames per Second: 0.0047 fps

- **With bounding box optimization**:  
  - Render Time: 114.454 seconds  
  - Frames per Second: 0.0087 fps

## Version B: Spatial data structure implementation

- **With spatial data structure**:  
  - Render Time: 8.592 seconds  
  - Frames per Second: 0.116387 fps
